# ALIVE Investigator
Project Overview

This project is developed by Centre for Digital Media students for University of British Columbia ALIVE Research Lab. This app was designed and developed to be run on iPadOS and hence, some scaling issues are to be expected in the demo builds.

The project contains two parts: an iPad game developed by Unity, and a server developed with Django. This public repository contains functional builds for demonstration purposes ONLY.

# Demo Builds

Upon running, you will be asked to fill a survey which, at this time, consists of one question and will open in your default browser. Upon answering the question you will be given a code which you are required to copy and paste back in the application to proceed.
